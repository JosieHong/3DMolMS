Documentation for 3DMolMS
=========================

**3D** **Mol**ecular Network for **M**ass **S**pectra Prediction (3DMolMS) is a deep neural network model to predict the MS/MS spectra of compounds from their 3D conformations. This model's molecular representation, learned through MS/MS prediction tasks, can be further applied to enhance performance in other molecular-related tasks, such as predicting retention times (RT) and collision cross sections (CCS).
