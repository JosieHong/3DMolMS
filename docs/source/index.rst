3DMolMS
=======

*Version* |release|

3DMolMS (*3D Molecular Network for Mass Spectra Prediction*) is a deep-learning model that predicts the tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra of small molecules from their 3D conformations. Its learned molecular representation also transfers to related tasks such as retention time (RT) and collision cross section (CCS) prediction.

Use 3DMolMS to:

* Predict MS/MS spectra for small molecules
* Predict molecular properties — retention time (RT) and collision cross section (CCS)
* Generate reference MS/MS libraries for compound identification
* Pretrain models on 3D molecular datasets

There are two ways to run it: the :doc:`molnetpack Python package <molnetpack>` for minimal-code inference and training, or the :doc:`command-line source code <sourcecode>` for full control. New to the input files? Start with :doc:`supported_formats`.
